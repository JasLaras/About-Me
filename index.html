            <h2>Hi! I'm Jasmine and...</h2>
            <div class="bubble-box">
                <p>I'm a current undergrad studying Computational Cognitive Science, an IT Assistant for Unitrans, and an aspiring AI/ML engineer!
                    I'm deeply fascinated with the intersectionality of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to the point of being involved 
                    in an education initiative for students and educators to share my knowledge and passion. I'm involved with the Girls
                    Who Code club as a board lead and Project Manager, and the Artificial Intelligence Student Collective as an Education Associate.
                    My profile picture is currently my cool dog Mocha who recently passed from lymphoma, he was always very photogenic.

            <div class="bubble-box">
                <p> My hobbies include gaming, reading research, studying languages (human and programming ones), and collecting Sonny Angel 
                    figurines. The picture shows my strawberry Sonny Angel figure posing next to some strawberry gum. I currently have about 40 
                    of these kewpie angels that resemble the Cupid-like babies you sometimes see in religious art and architecture. Some games 
                    I've been playing recently are ARK Survival Evolved, pass-time puzzle games like Wordle and Sudoku, Stardew Valley, Animal 
                    Crossing New Horizons, and Lethal Company. On research, I like reading research papers by the professors I have in any given 
                    quarter and articles by the MIT Tech Review.

    Write-up:
    My design choices are similar to the example, in which I also incorporated a background color gradient. I also decided to change the fonts 
    and add bubbles around the text to make the page look closer to the styles I see UI/UX student clubs choosing for their example mockups. 
    Responsive design was implemented by adjusting layout and image sizes to resize based on screen width. Accessibility was also addressed by 
    using HTML5 structure and adding alt attributes for images. I decided to write a brief intro about myself, academically and professionally 
    first and then introduce my interests and hobbies last. For privacy reasons, I used a picture of my dog rather than a picture of myself. 
    For a picture showcasing my interests, I wanted to use my own photo again rather than a stock photo from the internet. These were intended 
    to personalize the site to make it appear almost like a blog. My idea was to make it something I could see myself reposting onto my Instagram
    story. Some challenges I faced with this assignment were really silly and simple, like forgetting I need to add the file path when I link my 
    css file to the html. It’d been a while since I wrote an html/css page from scratch rather than editing already made ones. For about an 
    hour I couldn’t figure out why my css changes weren’t reflecting onto the page, so I constantly rewrote my css file to troubleshoot the 
    issue (like making the entire page bright red). I also had trouble adding font changes and learned I needed to link a url that contained the 
    fonts I wanted at the top of the html page.
